add raygui.h and src of raylib(v5.5 if possible) here!
down load raylib master
build raylib master using cmake 
you will find a folder named build that has libraylib.a file 
copy that file and put it in src forlder of raylib master 
now copy the whole src folder and paste it here :)
don't forget the raygui header file 
all that can be down loaded from  raylib github :) 
good luck soldier stay HARD
